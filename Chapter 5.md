<h3 id="organizing-your-web-application">5.1 Organizing Your Web Application</h3>
<p>A well-organized folder structure helps maintain clarity and order in your project. It makes it easier to find and manage files as the project grows.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating Folders</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your project directory, create folders for different components of your web application. For example:
<ul>
<li><code>css</code>: This folder will contain your CSS files.</li>
<li><code>js</code>: This is where you’ll store your JavaScript files.</li>
<li><code>images</code>: Store all image files here.</li>
<li><code>includes</code>: This folder may contain PHP files that you’ll include in multiple pages (e.g., header, footer).</li>
<li><code>user</code>: Create a folder for user-related files (e.g., user dashboard, profile page).</li>
<li><code>staff</code>: Similarly, create folders for staff-related files.</li>
<li><code>admin</code>: Create folders for admin-related files.</li>
<li><code>lib</code>: This is where you might store external libraries or frameworks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organizing Files</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place relevant files in their respective folders. For example, CSS files should go in the <code>css</code> folder, JavaScript files in the <code>js</code> folder, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="implementing-an-mvc-structure-optional">5.2 Implementing an MVC Structure (Optional)</h3>
<p>For larger applications, consider adopting an MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure to separate concerns and improve maintainability.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Models</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code>models</code> folder to hold PHP files responsible for interacting with the database. Each model corresponds to a specific table or entity in your database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Views</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>views</code> folder will contain the HTML files responsible for displaying the user interface. These files often include placeholders that get filled in by the controller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Controllers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <code>controllers</code> folder, you’ll have PHP files that handle the logic between the models and views. They process input from the user, interact with the models, and pass data to the views.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this chapter, we’ve established a folder structure for your web application. This organized approach will make it easier to manage files and components as your project grows. Additionally, we introduced the optional concept of an MVC structure, which can be particularly beneficial for larger applications.</p>
<p>In the next chapters, we’ll dive into creating user, staff, and admin dashboards, as well as implementing CRUD operations for each user type.</p>
