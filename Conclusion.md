<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, youâ€™ve learned how to create a simple web application using HTML5, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and the Apache web server. The guide covered various crucial aspects of web development, from setting up the development environment with Laragon to implementing security measures and enhancing the user interface.</p>
<h3 id="recap-of-key-concepts-covered">Recap of Key Concepts Covered:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Up Development Environment for the web app</strong>: Laragon was introduced as a powerful tool to bundle-install all the necessary components, making it easy for students to get started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating a Login Page</strong>: You learned how to create a basic HTML file for the login page and established the structure for user authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Up the Database</strong>: You set up a MySQL database and designed the user table schema, which included fields like <code>id</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>access_level</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Access Levels</strong>: Different user access levels (normal user, staff user, admin user) were implemented, allowing users to have different privileges within the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Folder Structure</strong>: You organized the project files into folders, ensuring a clean and manageable structure for your web application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementing User Dashboards</strong>: Individual dashboards were created for different user types, providing a personalized user experience based on their access level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CRUD Operations</strong>: You implemented CRUD operations, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records from the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Management</strong>: Session management was added to maintain user authentication across multiple pages, providing a seamless user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security Measures</strong>: Key security measures such as disabling directory listing, preventing SQL injection, and safeguarding against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks were implemented to protect the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing User Interface with CSS Frameworks</strong>: You learned how to choose and integrate CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material Design to improve the visual design and user experience of the application.</p>
</li>
